KERMIT for CP/M-80
------------------

This is a work in progress for the cleanup of KERMIT-80 code, starting with the last public release, v4.11.

See `cpxmit.asm` for an example of how to implement a basic system-dependent I/O module.

Until further notice, it's probably best to use the [Official Columbia CP/M Kermit files](http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/cpm.html) -- the files contained in this repository may be broken.
